Inkwell Property Group L.L.C is an online based real estate firm located in Indianapolis. We are a group of local real estate investors that buy houses throughout many Indiana counties. We provide a solution for selling your domicile without making repairs and updating the curb appeal. Lets us do the work.  Some homeowners sell because they want to upgrade or downsize. In other instances circumstances may arise due to sudden job transfer, bankruptcy, divorce, foreclosure and economic downturn. As a result, this all can require you to start looking to sell your house.   As real estate investors, we purchase properties for two main reasons. First is to buy properties, repair and add them to our portfolio. Secondly, is to make it one of the better homes in the neighborhood and over time place it back on the market. However, clients who choose to sell their house with Inkwell Property Group enjoy the benefit of walking away worry free. For example, we are not a sales driven firm, because we want to better understand how we can help with an exit strategy. No matter the reason for selling your property we are here to help and find a solution immediately. If there is an interest in selling a property let us know how we can help. Our process is simple and risk free. There is No Cost To Make An Offer, No Repairs Needed, and No Commission Fees. We are always available by phone, email, and contact form below.

Through our strong teamwork philosophy and dedication to design quality, we have created and administrated the construction of over 30 million square feet of enclosed space. Working closely with our client representatives and construction teams, this philosophy has brought about the unique architecture we are known for.  Buildings should be more than just monumental shells that look attractive from the road. They are that volume of finished interior spaces which provide the greatest operational capabilities. To ensure thorough integrations of ideas and experience, we select a team for each commission based on those project requirements. Each team includes a project architect, interior designer, technical support staff, and the required consultants; all under the direction of the principal-in-charge, who remains involved from start to finish. Whether or not a project includes full interior design services, we approach it in terms of a finished product, inside and out.  Today’s fast-paced economic markets demand a new process of development. Interest rates and financing aside, time and constructability are also crucial considerations. We have risen to these challenges by expanding the team approach, making the owner, architect and general contractor equal partners without a loss of critical checks and balances. The collaboration helps to reduce cost, increase efficiency, and enables each team member to give their best to the project. It is forum that has proven to be successful as well as beneficial; the invaluable experience that we possess and continue to gain is applied to our conventional client relationships as well.",www.coxkliewer.com,,,,+1 7574310033,Architecture and Planning,(11-50),16,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",0,"2533 VIRGINIA BEACH BLVD; Virginia Beach, Virginia, 23452, US",,S.

As a family business, another generation took the reigns in the 1990s and has continued to drive the operation forward with that same entrepreneurial spirit the business started with. In 2014, Demetree Real Estate Services merged with another well-known second generation property management firm to stage itself for rapid growth.",www.demetreerealestate.com,,,,(407) 984-4310,Leasing Non-residential Real Estate,(51-200),25,"Winter Park, Florida","Commercial Real Estate,Sales,Leasing,Property Management","1350 Orange Avenue; Winter Park, Florida, 32789, US",G,F

Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit housing organization working in local communities across all 50 states and in more than 70 countries around the world. Habitat’s vision is of a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Habitat works toward this vision by building and improving homes in partnership with individuals and families in need of a decent and affordable place to live. How does Habitat for Humanity’s homeownership program work? Families and individuals in need of decent, affordable housing apply for homeownership with their local Habitat for Humanity. Each local Habitat’s family selection committee selects homeowners based on three criteria: The applicant’s level of need. Their willingness to partner with Habitat. Their ability to repay a mortgage through an affordable payment plan. As part of their willingness to partner, Habitat’s homebuyers invest hundreds of hours of their own labor, called sweat equity, working alongside volunteers and other Habitat homeowners. Habitat for Humanity follows a nondiscriminatory policy of family selection. Neither race nor religion is a factor in choosing Habitat’s homeowners. What is a Habitat for Humanity ReStore? Habitat for Humanity ReStores are nonprofit home improvement stores and donation centers that sell new and gently used furniture, home accessories, building materials and appliances to the public at a fraction of the retail price. Habitat for Humanity ReStores are proudly owned and operated by local Habitat for Humanity affiliates. Proceeds are used to build homes and improve communities locally and around the world.

The recognition comes as part of the magazine's annual college rankings, which acknowledge the best of the country's institutions of higher education in a multitude of categories. We were also ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top colleges in the Northeast, higher than any other Long Island college in our category.

Le FLAC propose aux artistes un suivi à long terme et des formes de collaborations insolites.Le site Internet www.leflac.fr est envisagé comme un véritable lieu de recherche. Il provoque et accueille des créations inédites et une pensée autour de l'art contemporain.

La programmation s'appuie sur un réseau de collaborateurs étendu (artistes, auteurs, critiques, commissaires, médiateurs, amateurs...). Elle se compose d'une publication régulière d'écrits (essais critiques, littéraires, expérimentaux), d'expositions en ligne et d'une information variée sur les intervenants. À partir de la rentrée 2009, Le FLAC invitera des professionnels de l'art contemporain à investir l'ensemble du site par des propositions curatoriales.Le FLAC mène également des projets «hors site», expositions itinérantes qui concrétisent ses engagements : - Proposer aux artistes des moyens de production et des alternatives de diffusion, - Initier des dynamiques de travail et soutenir la diversité des créations contemporaines, - Développer des actions de médiation auprès des publics les plus variés, - Favoriser les partenariats avec d’autres structures culturelles.",www.leflac.fr,,,,0,Artists and Writers,0,1,0,0,0,J,Shelton

Since architecture changes our built environment it inherently creates experience. To experience is the process of doing, seeing, involvement in, participation in, contact with, exposure to, awareness of, and insight in to.  Our goal is to maximize authentic experiences.  Great experiences are created from a deep understanding of all of the parameters and opportunities and using them toward a directed goal. The design process may include analyzing the sun diagrams for the site to fill an area with natural light at the right time of day and season while keeping it out at other times.  It may be the tactile use of stone and wood by a local craftsman to connect a project to its natural site.  It may be the organizational system in a building that encourages interaction and creativity. This happens at the macro level of the site with its surrounding context down to the micro level of a detail of a stair rail.   It could be a large multi-purpose building in an urban environment to understanding the intimate relationships of how a family interacts with each other and nature in a rural setting.

Seeking to reorder architectural priorities by putting people first, ODA challenges conventional perspectives of dwelling that will, over time, influence life in our cities. Through a range of projects, ODA seeks to reconcile the conditions of vertical urban living with the qualities which benefit and nurture us as human beings: the desire for protected shelter while observing wide perspectives, the seamless transition between indoor and outdoor spaces, and the general improvement of life through good design. This prolific firm has gained extensive experience designing and building in New York – currently more than 40 projects in New York City and throughout the U.S. – making them uniquely positioned to lead the discourse of living in urban environments. The office’s buildings celebrate life, catalyzing change in their immediate environments. ODA creates value which by its nature can be replicated again in another form.  Eran Chen is the founding principal of ODA. His multi award-winning projects have been praised for their social responsibility, and innovative contributions to contemporary urban life, such as the National Library of Israel, East 44th Street, Manhattan’s ultrathin tower with open gardens; 123 Melrose, a one million square foot residential development; and Hunters Point South, NYC’s largest affordable housing project in more than forty years.

We created our Lifetime Warranty policy after we realized how frustrating the process of choosing the right cabinets can be.

I’m Megan Sauter, the creative force behind The Aura Home.  I started The Aura Home to help homeowners like you create unique, stylish homes that support your busy modern life. I offer various interior design services, products, and resources through my website, TheAuraHome.com, and my email newsletter.  I work with homeowners struggling to find their style or pick finishes and still others who “just can’t picture it.” The stress of pulling the room together on their own caused them to put their design dreams on hold.  Digging into my interior design and project management background, I walk my clients through the process from inspiration to finished space with a defined project path supported by floor plans, mood boards, and renderings. My process is a unique space that reflects their style and a relaxed and happy homeowner. Since starting my business, I have worked with clients both locally, in-person and remote via eDesign packages. I have helped homeowners transform awkward kitchens into beautiful family-friendly hubs, revamped a chic Parisian apartment, overhauled an unused basement to create a stylish rental apartment, and so much more.  If you’re a frustrated homeowner wishing for a beautiful space but sweating over paint swatches, I’m here to help. Please check out the services and resources on my website at TheAuraHome.com, subscribe to my email newsletter, or schedule a design consultation today.",www.theaurahome.com,,,,0,Architecture and Planning,0,1,"York, PA","Residential interior design,Floorplans,AutoCAD,Photoshop renderings,Planning,Project Management,Organizing",0,Megan,S.
