Savitzky-Golay filter is used in signal processing to eliminate noise in a signal and improve the smoothness of a signal trend. The filter calculates a polynomial fit of each window based on polynomial degree and window size. 

SciPy API provides the savgol_filter() function to implement Savitzky-Golay filter in Python. In this tutorial, we'll briefly learn how to smooth the signal data by using savgol_filter() function in Python.
