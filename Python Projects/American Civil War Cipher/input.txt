You might be wondering which way you should use to work with files between the combo of with and open() and just the open() function.
I would advise you to use the combination of with and open() because the with statement closes the file for you and you get to write less code.
Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to.
This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene â€“ __enter()__ and __exit()__.
The __exit()__ method closes the file when the operation you specify is done.
